  }
}
```

---

#### Phase 2: Meeting Creation

| Step | Actor | Action | Result |
|------|-------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Teacher/HOD | Clicks "Start Class" (15 min before scheduled time) | POST /api/meetings |
| 2 | Backend | Generates room code (e.g., `abc1234xyz`) | Meeting created |

  pendingApprovals: [],
  chatMessages: [],
  status: 'active',
  createdAt: ISODate('2025-01-15T10:00:00Z')
}
```

---

#### Phase 3: Student Join Flow

| Step | Actor | Action | Backend API | Result |

---

#### Phase 4: Host Approval Process

| Step | Actor | Action | Backend API | Result |
|------|-------|--------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Teacher/HOD | Opens meeting room | GET /api/meetings/abc1234xyz | Jitsi iframe loads |
| 2 | Frontend | Polls participants every 5 sec | GET /api/meetings/abc1234xyz/participants | Detects pending requests |
| 3 | Frontend | Shows red badge on Participants icon | - | Badge shows count (e.g., "2") |
| 4 | Teacher/HOD | Opens Participants panel | - | Sees pending users with Accept/Decline |
| 5 | Teacher/HOD | Clicks "Accept" | POST /api/meetings/abc1234xyz/approve | User status → 'accepted' |
| 6 | Frontend (Host) | Auto-reloads Jitsi iframe (1.5s delay) | - | Toast: "Refreshing connections..." |
| 7 | Frontend (Student) | Detects approval in polling | - | Toast: "Approved! Joining in 2 seconds..." |
| 8 | Frontend (Student) | Waits 2 seconds, then loads Jitsi | - | Enters meeting room |

**Permission Matrix:**
| Role | Can Approve? | Can Decline? | Can End Meeting? |
|------|-------------|--------------|------------------|
| Meeting Host | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Any Participant | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Teacher/HOD/Admin | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Student | ❌ No* | ❌ No* | ❌ No |

*Students can approve/decline if they're already in the meeting and another student requests to join (collaborative meetings).

---

#### Phase 5: Jitsi Connection & Auto-Reload Fix

**Problem:** Jitsi uses peer-to-peer WebRTC. If users join at different times, they don't establish connections.

**Solution:** Auto-reload host's iframe when approving to force peer discovery.

| Timestamp | Host Action | Student Action | WebRTC Status |
|-----------|------------|----------------|---------------|
| t=0s | Clicks "Accept" | Polls and detects approval | Not connected |
| t=1.5s | Iframe starts reloading | Waits countdown | Not connected |
| t=2.0s | Iframe still reloading | Loads Jitsi iframe | Peer discovery starts |
| t=2.5s | Iframe fully reloaded | Jitsi joining room | Connecting... |
| t=3.5s | Jitsi fully loaded | Jitsi fully loaded | WebRTC handshake |
| t=4.0s | ✅ Sees student video | ✅ Sees host video | ✅ Connected! |

**Technical Implementation:**

```javascript
// 1. Host approves student
async function handleApproval(userId, approve) {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/meetings/${roomCode}/approve`, {
        method: 'POST',
        body: JSON.stringify({ userId, approve })
    });
    
    if (approve && jitsiFrame) {
        toast('Student approved — they will join now');
        
        // Wait 1.5s, then reload iframe with cache buster
        setTimeout(() => {
            const currentSrc = jitsiFrame.src;
            const baseSrc = currentSrc.split('&_t=')[0];
            jitsiFrame.src = baseSrc + '&_t=' + Date.now(); // Force fresh connection
            toast('Refreshing connections...');
        }, 1500);
    }
}

// 2. Student detects approval and waits before entering
if (accepted && accepted.status === 'accepted') {
    clearInterval(approvalPollTimer);
    toast('Approved! Joining meeting in 2 seconds...');
    
    setTimeout(() => {
        enterMeetingRoom(); // Load Jitsi iframe
    }, 2000);
}

// 3. Jitsi iframe with cache buster
const jitsiUrl = `https://meet.jit.si/${roomName}` +
    `#config.prejoinPageEnabled=false` +
    `&config.startWithAudioMuted=false` +
    `&config.startWithVideoMuted=false` +
    `&_t=${Date.now()}`; // Timestamp prevents caching
```

**Result:** Both users connect in ~4 seconds with no rejoin needed! ✅

---

#### Phase 6: In-Meeting Experience

| Feature | Implementation | Update Frequency |
|---------|---------------|------------------|
| **Video/Audio** | Jitsi WebRTC iframe | Real-time (peer-to-peer) |
| **Chat** | Backend storage + polling | 3-6 seconds |
| **Participants** | Backend + polling | 5 seconds |
| **Screen Share** | Jitsi built-in button | Real-time |
| **Hand Raise** | Jitsi built-in button | Real-time |
| **Mic/Cam Toggle** | Jitsi built-in controls | Instant |

**Chat System:**
```javascript
// Send message
async function sendMessage() {
    await fetch(`/api/meetings/${roomCode}/chat`, {
        method: 'POST',
        body: JSON.stringify({ message: 'Hello!' })
    });
}

// Poll for new messages every 3 seconds
setInterval(async () => {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/meetings/${roomCode}/chat`);
    const messages = await response.json();
    updateChatUI(messages);
}, 3000);
```

**Participants Panel:**
- Shows all users with status indicators (green dot = online)
- Mic/camera status icons
- Pending approval badges (red badge with count)
- Accept/Decline buttons for pending users

---

#### Phase 7: End Meeting

| Step | Actor | Action | Backend API | Result |
|------|-------|--------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Teacher/HOD | Clicks "End" button | - | Confirmation modal appears |
| 2 | Teacher/HOD | Confirms end | POST /api/meetings/abc1234xyz/end | Meeting status → 'ended' |
| 3 | Backend | 3-Layer Clearing System | - | See table below |
| 4 | Backend | Sets `schedule.lastMeetingEnded = Date.now()` | - | Tracks when ended |
| 5 | Frontend | All users' polling detects ended | GET /api/meetings/abc1234xyz | Status = 'ended' |
| 6 | All Users | Redirected to "Class Completed" screen | - | Jitsi iframe removed |
| 7 | Student | Views dashboard | - | Shows "Class Completed" (not Join button) |
| 8 | Teacher/HOD | Views dashboard | - | Shows "Online" (not "Live") |

**3-Layer Clearing System:**

| Layer | Method | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Layer 1** | Clear by classId | Direct match (primary method) |
| **Layer 2** | Clear by meetingLink match | Edge cases where classId missing |
| **Layer 3** | Clear by room code regex | Safety net for orphaned links |

```javascript
// Layer 1: Direct clear
await Class.updateOne(
    { _id: classId },
    { $unset: { meetingLink: "" } }
);

// Layer 2: Edge case clear
await Class.updateMany(
    { meetingLink: roomCode },
    { $unset: { meetingLink: "" } }
);

// Layer 3: Regex safety net
await Class.updateMany(
    { meetingLink: { $regex: roomCode, $options: 'i' } },
    { $unset: { meetingLink: "" } }
);
```

**Result:** Meeting link fully cleared, students see "Class Completed", old link stops working ✅
